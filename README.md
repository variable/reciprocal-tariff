## About

This is a clone of tariff project for reciprocal purpose.
This is about making the importing of tariff equally painful


## Installation

```bash
pip install reciprocal-tariff
```

## Usage

```python
import reciprocal_tariff

# Now when you import tariff package, they'll be TARIFFED!
import tariff # This will be 100% slower
```

## How It Works

When you import a package that has a tariff:
1. TARIFF measures how long the original import takes
2. TARIFF makes the import take longer based on your tariff percentage
3. TARIFF announces the tariff with a TREMENDOUS message
